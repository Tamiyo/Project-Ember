### Project-Ember
Project Ember's development has since been discontinued as the team has disbanded. However the project repo hold 5 years of committed work of programmers / animators working together on the same project to develop a videogame


***PROJECT_EMBER IS CURRENTLY BEING HOSTED @ https://bitbucket.org/emberproject/project-ember-ue4. Access may be restricted, I am attempting to find a public version / demo***


# Welcome to Ember

<br/>
Project Ember's development has currently come to a standstill, and there is no known date when development will resume. Ember was originally a way for a group of friends to practice their skills for fun, but eventually it turned into a large project. Though it was only worked on during our free time, we have all come to cherish the memories that we had during our development process. 5 years of developmental assets from the codebase to the animations have brought forth what we have today: Ember.


## Ember at a Glance

Project Ember is a third-person sword fighting game based in a cyberpunk style world. Unofficially an agile project, Ember allows the user to have an arcadey yet skillful combat system to battle npcs and other users alike. Employing different gameplay mechanics, including but not limited to:
  * Dodge / Roll mechanics
  * Unique sword techniques and combos
  * Varying classes and skills
  * Parkour
  * Grapple mechanics
  * Teleportation

## The Problems

<br/>
Ember was a very ambitious project. A small group of students who have never even attempted to make a game before? Easy! There were many struggles that we had to go through during the development process. We would hit blockers where we would depend on other teammates assets to continue our stories, however since we worked on the game sparingly that could mean huge amounts of time not being put into development. Kudos to our animator, the quality of the animations were very solid and he put a lot of time into them. 
<br/>
Some other issues that persisted were the lack of 3D models / environmental resources at the time. None of the team members had professional 3D modeling skills, and without a budget it was hard to find people to perform the job or to buy models from third party sources
<br/>
We also had some code efficiency issues due to our inexperience with computer science logic that could have made a few processes easier to overcome, and perhaps have helped us scale some of the obstacles we encountered

## The Outcome

<br/>
Overall, I'm very proud of the work done in Ember. It was a very positive experience for me as well as the other team members. Together we grew and gained team development and source control experience. I hope to one day revisit this project and finish it to completion; there are many valuable open source resources out there currently that could fill in the gaps that we had during development. Thank you for all of those whom kept up with us, your support was very constructive for the team.
