Project Ember development has currently come to a standstill, and there is no known date when development will resume. Ember was orignally a way for a group of friends to practice their skills for fun, but eventually it turned into a large project. Though it was only worked on during our free time, we have all come to cherish the memories that we had during our development process. 5 years of developmental assets from the codebase to the animations have brought forth what we have today: Ember.
