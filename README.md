### Project-Ember
Project Ember's development has since been discontinued as the team has disbanded. However the project repo hold 5 years of commited work of programmers / animators working together on the same project to develop a videogame

# Welcome to Ember

Project Ember development has currently come to a standstill, and there is no known date when development will resume. Ember was orignally a way for a group of friends to practice their skills for fun, but eventually it turned into a large project. Though it was only worked on during our free time, we have all come to cherish the memories that we had during our development process. 5 years of developmental assets from the codebase to the animations have brought forth what we have today: Ember.


## Ember at a Glance

Project Ember is a third-person sword fighting game based in a cyberpunk style world. Unofficially an agile project, Ember allows the user to have an arcadey yet skillful combat system to battle npcs and other users alike. Employing different gameplay mechanics, including but not limited to:
  * Dodge / Roll mechanics
  * Unique sword techniques and combos
  * Varying classes and skills
  * Parkour
  * Grapple mechanics
  * Teleportation
  

## The Problems

Ember was a very ambitious project. A small group of students who have never even attempted to make a game before? Easy! There were many struggles that we had to go through during the development process. We would hit blockers where we would depend on other teammates assets to continue our stories, however since we worked on the game sparingly that could mean huge amounts of time not being put into development. Kudos to our animator, the quality of the animations were very solid and he put a lot of time into them. 


Some other issues that persisted were the lack of 3D models / environmental resources at the t ime. None of the team members had professional 3D modeling skills, and without a budget it was hard to find people to perform the job or to buy models from third party sources
